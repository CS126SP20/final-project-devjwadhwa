### Project Description:
 My project will be an implementation of a 2 Player Chess Game.
 The objective of this game is to take control of the board and checkmating your opponent's King.
 Here is a basic introduction of the game for reference -  
[Chess Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlTEQZ5Sy4E).
    
### Motivation:
 Chess is a game the author played while growing up with his father and brother.
 Thus, he always wanted to try to code since he learnt coding in CS 125.
 The sentimental value attached to it is the main driving factor.  
 
 This project helped the author hone his coding skills and explore the different functionalities of Cinder, 
 its external libraries and its blocks. 


### Tentative Timeline:

#### Week 2 (starting 04/25 - new project) - 

##### Engine: 
* Setup of external libraries 
* Key movement
* A moving Marker (or Cursor)
* Moving Keys for both players
* Knows which piece can move how much (the rules)

###### Graphics: 
* The Background Grid

* Detect when Game is over

##### Graphics: 
Development of :-
* Leader board
* Pause game menu
