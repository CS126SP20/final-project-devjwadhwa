 ##### Project Description:
 The project is an implementation of Chess - a 2 PLayer arcade game.
 The objective of this game is to check and mate the opposite team's King.
 Here is a basic game-play of one of the versions of the game for reference -

 ##### Motivation:
 Chess is a game the author played while growing up with his father and brother.
 Thus, he always wanted to try to code since he learnt coding in CS 125.
 The sentimental value attached to it is the main driving factor.  
 
 This project helped the author hone his coding skills and explore the different functionalities of Cinder, 
 its external libraries and its blocks.
